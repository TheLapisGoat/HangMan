# Hangman

A Deep Learning Model that plays the [Hangman Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).

The model was made with the Keras Functional API. It predicts the probability of each character's appearance in the word being guessed and updates these probabilities based on the incorrect and correct guesses made.
